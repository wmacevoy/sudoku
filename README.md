## Main Page

The main page is an printable and shareable sudoku puzzle you can play online.

Each of the 81 cells can be certain or uncertain.  When uncertain, there are 9 possible options (1-9) displayed in a 3x3 subcell grid when the sub cell grid option (#) is enabled.

 - Keyboard with no subcell grid: arrows select the active cell. 1-9 on an uncertain cell makes that cell certainly that value. ? on a certain cell makes that cell uncertain.
 - Keyboard with subcell grid: arrows select the active cell. Shift + 1-9 on an uncertain cell makes that cell certainly that value. Shift ? on a certain cell makes that cell uncertain.  1-9 on an uncertain cell toggles that option in that subgrid. ? or Shift-? on an uncertain cell updates all options in cell according to row/column/box elimination.
 - Mouse/tap with no subgrid: first select the ? or digit action below the puzzle. Click/tap of an unselected cell makes that cell active, and, if a digit action is selected and that cell is not currently selected, selects that digit value for the cell.  If the ? action is chosen and the clicked cell is certain, that cell is made uncertain.
 - Mouse/tap with subgrid: first select ? or digit action below the puzzle. Click/tap of an unselected cell makes that cell active, and:
   If a digit action is selected and the clicked/tapped  cell is not currently selected, toggles that digit option for the cell.  Double click/tap makes an uncertain cell certain.
   If the ? action is selected and the clicked/tapped uncertain, the options in cell are updated according to row/column/box elimination.  Double click/tap makes a certain cell uncertain.

### Help

With the cell subgrid enabled, clicking help updates all uncertain cells with row/column/box eliminations. While help is enabled, making a cell certain eliminates that option from all uncertain cells in the row, column, and box.

### Print
If '#' is enabled, sub-cell grid lines are generated. The center subcell takes 50% of the vertical and horizonal space of the cell. This facilitates checking the solutions when running as a paper contest and promotes neater work while working out options of a cell. The options are printed in their respective sub-grids if available, with the 5 option shifted to the top so as to not disturb the center area for the choice of certain value.

## Compete!

This generates a complete set of puzzles for a competition:

 - Individuals or teams of 2 get puzzles in order (A, B, C, ...) on paper.
 - If they correctly solve a puzzle (keys are printed for judging), they get 10 points and the next puzzle.
 - If they are incorrect, the lose a point and start over on the same puzzle.

After the contest (30 minutes is recommended) the high scores are announced, and teams that solved more puzzles help teams finish thier last unfinished puzzle.

The real goal is to practice for the contest - there little gained from just the contest, but a lot to be gained from regular offline practice.
