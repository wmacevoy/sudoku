# Evaluating Cognitive Trends in Students and the Case for a Team‑Based Paper Sudoku Contest

## Synopsis

Research published since the late 20th century shows a complex picture of cognitive change across generations.  **Selective attention among adults appears to have improved moderately**, while children show faster processing but more errors【716899265567794†L69-L77】.  **Working‑memory capacity has stagnated or declined** in recent cohorts【716899265567794†L152-L158】.  **Creative thinking scores on the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking remain static or have fallen since 1990**, particularly for younger students【661778453783205†L46-L54】, although some later meta‑analyses disagree.  Widespread adoption of smartphones and social media is associated with reduced attention, weaker memory retention, impaired decision‑making and diminished creativity【765909904292581†L263-L305】【219255909134333†L168-L186】.  The COVID‑19 pandemic further exacerbated declines in memory and flexible thinking across age groups【127437487322267†L183-L242】.  Early evidence suggests that over‑reliance on large language models (LLMs) lowers neural engagement and memory integration【402289611078977†L32-L40】【402289611078977†L95-L99】 and encourages cognitive shortcuts【319972422635090†L94-L102】.  Conversely, regular engagement with logic puzzles such as Sudoku is linked with better attention, reasoning and memory; puzzle players perform like people 8–10 years younger on cognitive tests【902720689424440†L36-L68】.  Team‑based paper Sudoku contests could therefore serve as a low‑cost intervention to strengthen attention, reasoning, memory and communication skills, reduce dependence on phones and foster collaborative problem‑solving.  A convincing case to instructors should connect the contest directly to documented cognitive challenges, emphasising the contest’s simplicity and alignment with the skills needed for academic success and programming contests.

## 1 How cognition in students has changed over time

### 1.1 Selective attention

A cross‑temporal meta‑analysis of 287 samples spanning 1990–2021 (N ≈ 21 000) examined generational trends on the **d2 Test of Attention**.  Adults showed **moderate gains in concentration performance**, whereas children’s scores showed no improvement【716899265567794†L69-L77】.  The absence of gains in children was accompanied by increased error rates and processing speed, suggesting more **impulsive and superficial attention**【716899265567794†L69-L77】.  Another meta‑analysis noted that processing speed improved but selective attention in children may have plateaued【716899265567794†L69-L77】, hinting at a possible ceiling reached by formal schooling and computerised environments.

### 1.2 Memory retention and working memory

Research on generational changes in memory is less consistent.  Some studies report gains in declarative and short‑term memory【716899265567794†L152-L154】, but **working‑memory capacity shows stagnation or decline**【716899265567794†L152-L158】.  This negative trend may be related to increased **memory off‑loading** to digital devices.  Experiments show that the mere presence of a smartphone drains available cognitive resources; participants with their phone in another room perform significantly better on memory and reasoning tasks than those with their phone visible【689738971413192†L50-L107】.  A meta‑analysis confirms that **smartphone presence/use negatively affects memory, attention and general cognitive performance**【271884071551890†L379-L443】.

Several recent studies highlight **digital amnesia**—the tendency to forget information stored on digital devices.  A cross‑sectional study found that 64.9 % of nursing students experienced moderate digital amnesia despite low/moderate smartphone dependency【108697784636723†L771-L812】.  Off‑loading memory to devices leads to shallow processing and poorer retention【108697784636723†L859-L871】.

### 1.3 Reasoning, decision‑making and critical thinking

The modern digital environment fosters **continuous partial attention**, information overload and multitasking, which impair reasoning and decision‑making.  A comprehensive review describes how constant notifications and fear of missing out (FOMO) create attentional overload, reduce the ability to think deeply and encourage impulsive choices【765909904292581†L263-L305】.  Excessive smartphone or internet use is associated with **reduced executive function and poorer decision‑making**【765909904292581†L508-L566】.  Over‑reliance on algorithms and recommendation systems can bias decisions【765909904292581†L690-L754】.

### 1.4 Creativity

Creativity exhibits divergent trends.  Kyung Hee Kim’s large analysis of the **Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT)** showed that creative thinking scores **remained static or declined** starting at sixth grade and that scores **significantly decreased after 1990**, despite rising IQ scores【661778453783205†L46-L54】.  The decline was most pronounced among kindergarten–third grade students【661778453783205†L46-L54】.  Kim argued that contemporary schooling and societal pressures for conformity might stifle creative expression【661778453783205†L235-L274】.  Later meta‑analyses challenge the “creativity crisis” narrative, but they acknowledge that measurement and normative changes complicate conclusions.  Regardless, **smartphone addiction shows a clear negative association with creativity**.  A 2025 survey of 2 900 Chinese college students found that smartphone addiction negatively predicted creativity (b = –0.158, p < 0.001) and that negative emotion mediated the effect【219255909134333†L168-L186】.  The authors proposed that smartphone addiction may **atrophy the prefrontal cortex, encourage shallow information processing and reduce conceptual flexibility**【219255909134333†L256-L264】.

### 1.5 Academic performance and the COVID‑19 pandemic

Standardised test scores in the United States reveal declines in academic achievement.  National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data show that the average 13‑year‑old’s mathematics skills have reverted to **1990 levels**, and reading scores have fallen below **1971 levels**【397582038439185†L159-L168】.  A working paper summarised by the New York Times reported that students across age groups exhibit **weaker memory and flexible thinking** after the COVID‑19 pandemic; children aged 8–13 experienced the largest decline in memory【127437487322267†L183-L242】.  Lower‑income students suffered bigger drops in verbal reasoning and memory【127437487322267†L183-L242】.  Teachers also exhibited declines in verbal memory and flexibility【127437487322267†L183-L242】, potentially compounding the problem.

## 2 Drivers of cognitive change

### 2.1 Smartphones and social media

The **brain‑drain effect**: A study at the University of Texas demonstrated that just having a smartphone within sight significantly reduces cognitive capacity; participants with phones on the desk performed worse on working‑memory and problem‑solving tasks than those who left phones in another room【689738971413192†L50-L107】.  This effect was stronger among individuals who reported higher smartphone dependence【689738971413192†L50-L107】.  A broader meta‑analysis of 33 studies confirmed that **smartphone presence or use impairs memory, attention and general cognitive performance**【271884071551890†L379-L443】.

**Attention and ADHD symptoms**: A longitudinal study found that adolescents using digital devices more than 10 min/day had increased attention problems and higher rates of ADHD symptoms【471352195849204†L631-L648】.  Heavy smartphone use in young adults is linked to impaired attention and lower numerical processing【471352195849204†L631-L666】.

**Digital amnesia and memory off‑loading**: Constant smartphone use encourages external storage of information.  The nursing‑student study noted above found moderate digital amnesia in 64.9 % of students【108697784636723†L771-L812】.  When people rely on devices to remember facts, they encode information less deeply and retrieve it less effectively【108697784636723†L859-L871】.

**Creativity and emotional effects**: Smartphone addiction not only decreases creativity【219255909134333†L168-L186】 but also increases negative emotion, which further impairs creative thinking【219255909134333†L168-L186】.  Structural degradation of the prefrontal cortex and shallow processing may mediate this relationship【219255909134333†L256-L264】.

**Continuous partial attention and FOMO**: Social media platforms are designed to maximise engagement through notifications and infinite scrolling.  The resulting **continuous partial attention** splits focus across multiple streams of information, leading to attentional overload and reduced deep thinking【765909904292581†L263-L305】.

### 2.2 The COVID‑19 pandemic

The pandemic disrupted in‑person schooling, increased screen time and elevated stress.  Many students and teachers reported **weaker memory and flexible thinking**, with younger students experiencing the greatest decline【127437487322267†L183-L242】.  Social isolation and online learning may have diminished opportunities for sustained attention and collaborative problem‑solving.

### 2.3 Large language models and AI

Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT provide convenient access to information and can accelerate writing and programming.  However, emerging studies indicate **cognitive downsides**.  An MIT Media Lab study (pre‑review) asked 54 participants to write SAT essays with ChatGPT, Google search or no tool.  EEG recordings showed that **ChatGPT users exhibited the lowest brain engagement**, underperforming on neural, linguistic and behavioural measures【402289611078977†L32-L40】.  Their essays were similar, lacked originality and became increasingly copy‑and‑paste over time【402289611078977†L73-L79】.  When later asked to re‑write an essay without ChatGPT, this group remembered little and showed weaker alpha and theta brain waves, suggesting poor memory integration【402289611078977†L95-L99】.  By contrast, participants who wrote without AI showed higher neural connectivity, greater creative ideation and higher satisfaction【402289611078977†L83-L87】.

A 2024 **systematic review** of 14 studies on over‑reliance on AI dialogue systems found that ethical issues such as AI hallucinations, algorithmic biases and plagiarism encourage users to accept AI outputs uncritically.  Over‑reliance leads individuals to favour **fast heuristics over slower analytical thinking**, impairing decision‑making and critical thinking【319972422635090†L94-L102】.  Regular use of AI dialogue systems was linked to declines in information retention and increased dependence on AI for answers【319972422635090†L159-L167】.

### 2.4 Single‑focus, high‑distraction environments

Smartphones provide an **infinite array of options** but confine attention to a small window.  This “small field of view + high distraction” context encourages rapid switching between tasks and hinders deep work.  Multi‑device use is associated with lower comprehension scores and impaired learning【765909904292581†L766-L799】.  Students increasingly allocate attention to multiple streams (social media, messaging, video), reducing sustained attention to classroom material and diminishing complex reasoning.

## 3 Are students losing cognitive capacity?  A balanced assessment

The evidence supports both **growth and decline** in different cognitive domains.  **Selective attention and some memory components show improvement or stability in adults**, likely due to improved health and education.  **Working‑memory capacity and creative thinking appear stagnant or declining**, especially among younger students【716899265567794†L152-L158】【661778453783205†L46-L54】.  **Academic test scores in mathematics and reading have declined** to levels seen decades ago【397582038439185†L159-L168】, and the pandemic has exacerbated deficits in memory and flexible thinking【127437487322267†L183-L242】.  Simultaneously, ubiquitous digital technology has introduced **new cognitive stresses**—attentional overload, memory off‑loading, creative inhibition and reliance on algorithmic heuristics.  While generational changes in cognition may not be wholly negative, **current college students face unique challenges** that did not exist for older instructors.

## 4 Evidence for puzzles and team‑based activities

### 4.1 Cognitive benefits of Sudoku and logic puzzles

Puzzles such as Sudoku demand logical reasoning, pattern recognition and sustained attention.  A functional near‑infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) study showed that solving a Sudoku puzzle activates both medial and lateral regions of the **prefrontal cortex**, the area responsible for executive functions like working memory, problem‑solving and decision‑making【407078866188867†L190-L203】.  The authors concluded that Sudoku could be used for **cognitive remediation training** in disorders involving the PFC【407078866188867†L190-L203】.

A **large online study** of more than 19 000 adults aged 50+ found that people who regularly complete word and number puzzles (crosswords and Sudoku) perform better on tests assessing attention, reasoning and memory.  Their brain function was equivalent to being **eight years younger in short‑term memory** and **ten years younger in grammatical reasoning**【902720689424440†L36-L68】.  The improvements were particularly striking in speed and accuracy【902720689424440†L63-L67】.  This does not prove causation but suggests that regular engagement with puzzles is associated with preserved cognitive function.

An earlier study linked Sudoku performance to **working‑memory capacity** in both younger and older adults.  Sudoku performance had a significant positive relationship with working memory, suggesting that practice could contribute to maintaining working memory in older adults【219597766750040†L41-L46】.

### 4.2 Collaborative problem‑solving and communication

Collaboration enhances learning and cognitive processing.  Team‑based problem‑solving requires **verbalising reasoning, negotiating strategies and recognising alternative solutions**.  Working in pairs encourages students to **monitor each other’s approaches**, catch mistakes and refine their thinking.  The social interaction also develops communication skills and fosters empathy.  In the context of Sudoku, collaboration may prompt students to explain logical steps, articulate constraints and collectively decide on moves—activities that mirror pair programming and group problem‑solving.

### 4.3 Reducing phone dependency

Conducting puzzles **on paper** forces students to disconnect from digital devices.  By physically removing phones during the contest (similar to the brain‑drain study’s “phone in another room” condition), participants free up cognitive resources and practise sustained attention【689738971413192†L50-L107】.  The format encourages them to rely on each other rather than on smartphones or AI tools, reinforcing memory and reasoning rather than off‑loading them.

### 4.4 A low‑cost surrogate for programming contests

International Collegiate Programming Contests (ICPC) require teams to solve algorithmic problems under time pressure, fostering collaboration, problem‑solving and communication.  Organising such contests demands access to computers, networks and carefully designed programming problems.  In contrast, a **paper‑based Sudoku contest** replicates the contest dynamics (progressive difficulty, penalty for incorrect submissions, teamwork) with **minimal logistical overhead**—just printed puzzles, pens and proctors.  The contest can include a penalty (e.g., 20 minutes) for incorrect solutions to mimic ICPC scoring.  As teams progress through increasingly difficult puzzles, they practise sustained attention, flexible reasoning and resilience.

## 5 Is a paper Sudoku contest valuable?

Given the evidence, **yes**—such a contest aligns with several educational goals:

1. **Addressing cognitive weaknesses**.  Empirical research shows that modern students struggle with sustained attention, working memory and creativity due to smartphones, social media, pandemic disruptions and over‑reliance on AI.  A paper Sudoku contest targets these very skills by requiring focused attention, logical reasoning, memory for constraints and creative problem‑solving.

2. **Reinforcing collaboration and communication**.  Working in pairs fosters interpersonal skills, mirroring the pair‑programming or team problem‑solving that computer science majors need.  Explaining reasoning out loud helps solidify understanding and improves meta‑cognition.

3. **Reducing digital distraction**.  Prohibiting phones during the contest removes the brain‑drain effect【689738971413192†L50-L107】 and encourages students to experience flow without constant interruptions.  The experience could remind them of the benefits of deep work.

4. **Accessible and scalable**.  Sudoku puzzles can be generated algorithmically at varying difficulty levels, printed cheaply and verified easily.  Instructors do not need to create complex problem sets or manage computer infrastructure.  This makes the contest feasible for small classes or large events.

5. **Evidence‑aligned**.  Puzzles like Sudoku engage the prefrontal cortex【407078866188867†L190-L203】, correlate with working‑memory capacity【219597766750040†L41-L46】 and are linked with better attention, reasoning and memory【902720689424440†L36-L68】.  Thus, the contest is not just “fun”; it is a research‑supported intervention.

## 6 How to communicate the value to instructors

1. **Ground the discussion in data**.  Present instructors with key findings: selective attention improvements are limited to adults【716899265567794†L69-L77】; working‑memory capacity has stagnated【716899265567794†L152-L158】; creative thinking scores have fallen since 1990【661778453783205†L46-L54】; smartphone presence drains cognitive capacity【689738971413192†L50-L107】; pandemic‑era students exhibit weaker memory and flexibility【127437487322267†L183-L242】; early evidence suggests LLMs reduce brain engagement and memory integration【402289611078977†L32-L40】【402289611078977†L95-L99】; and over‑reliance on AI encourages cognitive shortcuts【319972422635090†L94-L102】.  This background helps instructors appreciate that students face novel challenges that did not exist when they were in school.

2. **Highlight the benefits of puzzles**.  Emphasise the research linking frequent puzzle use with better attention, reasoning and memory, equivalent to being 8–10 years younger【902720689424440†L36-L68】.  Mention that solving Sudoku engages executive functions in the prefrontal cortex【407078866188867†L190-L203】 and correlates with working‑memory capacity【219597766750040†L41-L46】.

3. **Draw analogies to programming contests**.  Explain that a pair‑based Sudoku contest mirrors the ICPC structure: teamwork, time pressure, progressive difficulty and penalties for incorrect submissions.  This makes it not merely a game but **preparation for more demanding contests** and careers.

4. **Address potential scepticism**.  Some instructors may view puzzles as trivial or unrelated to computer science.  Point out that Sudoku requires algorithmic thinking—constraint propagation, backtracking and search.  Solving puzzles trains the same reasoning strategies used in programming (e.g., eliminating impossible values, considering branching possibilities) but in a lower‑stakes environment.  Emphasise that collaborative reasoning and clear communication are valued in industry.

5. **Emphasise holistic benefits**.  The contest fosters **in‑person social interaction**, resilience, stress management and the joy of problem‑solving—qualities often eroded by digital distraction.  By building a sense of community, the activity can improve student well‑being and motivation.

6. **Offer a pilot**.  Suggest running a small pilot contest and collecting feedback from participants and observers.  Evidence of improved engagement and enthusiasm may convince sceptical colleagues.

## 7 Conclusion

Generational trends in cognition reveal both gains and troubling declines.  Smartphones, social media, the COVID‑19 pandemic and emerging AI tools have created an environment where attention, memory and creativity are under pressure.  Students today must learn to **manage distractions, maintain deep focus and think critically**—skills that older instructors may have developed more organically.  Evidence‑based interventions are needed to counteract these pressures.  **Team‑based paper Sudoku contests** offer a simple, scalable and research‑aligned approach to strengthen attention, reasoning, memory and communication skills while reducing dependence on digital devices.  By presenting instructors with empirical data and drawing clear connections between the contest and cognitive health, advocates can make a compelling case for integrating such events into educational programs.
