# Games vs. War

You are under attack. I am attacking you right now.

Instead of wasting your attention right now reading this sentence, you could be seeing if someone liked that post, or you could drop this whole article into an LLM and ask for some key takeaways while playing fortnight with the sound down.

In the distant past, food was a scarce resource.  A tribe member would suffer many bee stings for a rare and wonderful treat of honey to share for their bravery and perserverence. Today calories wrapped in dopamine inducing flavors are in over-abundance, making real food taste boring. With respect to food, we have moved from using perseverence to obtain food to perseverence to avoid food substitues.

In the recent past, information was a scarce resource. Cowboys would memorize shakespear plays and long poems to pass the time on the range. Scholars would travel for months or years to gain some new insight. Today your attention is under siege with low quality substitutes.  If you got to this sentence, how many times have you thought about quitting and reading something more entertaining.  See that notification bubble? It could be fun!

Its unfair, really, that you were born into this war. If you want people to win at a fight, it's nice to train them before you send them into the fray.  But you are living the fray; it is the modern world around you. Welcome to The Matrix.

It is a war? Are you winning or losing? What are the stakes? Well I don't know you, but the overall data is pretty grim.

* Your health and body image.
* Your emotional and social health.
* Your ability to focus, reason, and remember.
* Your ability to think creatively.
* Your understanding and implementation of happiness.
* How you view and interact with others.

Bummer kind of list, and you could do something else, so maybe just turn up fortnite.

## Happiness

Definition: a combination of comfort, contentment, and purpose.
Clearly written in reverse order of importance to the sense of happiness.
Rescuing a friend from a broken-down car in a snowstorm can be very unconfortable and both be and grow happiness. Joy? Look at someone fullfilling what they know is thier purpose.  Let's just get that out of the way.


## The War

Who you are is some essential and changing part of your mind. Agency is having you fundamentally guide what that is. Awareness, attention, reason and doubt are your tools to build your agency. The War is you giving that away for the comfort part of happiness.

## The Spear

Easy rewards. Biggie Fries. Share the post. ChatGPT and done.

Don't mistake comfort for happiness. That's the main trap.  Sugar is not food. Scrolling is not purpose. Asking ChatGPT to do your homework is not learning.

## The Sheild

Not talking about a bunch of monks walking around. But can you choose --- do you have agency? That's your shield.

## War Games

Games are things you do that you don't have to, that you enjoy. Many games are part of the attack, they do not create happiness.  Good games help you in the War. They should fit somewhere in the comfort-contentment scale but not be purpose.  If they are purpose then they are not a game to you.

Games that help you in The War will look low on the comfort/contentment scale compared, say, to hitting up on Meth, Porn, or Social Media.  As least for a little while.  Longer term you may look back at that junk yard and notice the smell.

Here are some games

* Sudoku
* Chess
* Disc Golf
* Ping Pong
* Cooking
* Dancing

There are lots of them.

### Stupid Games



Cooking is a game. You don't need to cook, but you can. If you listen to "In Defense of Food" by Micheal Pollen (who reads anymore), you might understand how this game might save your health.
